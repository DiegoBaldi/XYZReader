Project Overview
In this project, I've redesigned an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project?
This project has gave me the opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, I have:

* Understood the fundamentals of Android design.
* Applied Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
* Separated an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively used transitions and motion.
